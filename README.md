 1.This Project contains 10 questions.Each Question should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees and disagress with the question

 2.servser.js file should require the basic npm packages we've user in class:express,body-parserand path 

 3.Your htmlRoutes.js file includes two routes:
  	-A GET Route to /survey which should display the survey page. 
  	-A default, catch-all route that leads to home.html which displays the home page.
 4.apiRoutes.js file containes two routes: 
 	-A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
  	-A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic. 
 5.Application's data inside of app/data/friends.js as an array of objects. Each of these objects roughly follow the format below. { "name":"Ahmed", "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg", "scores":[ 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1 ] }

 6.Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide: Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]). With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.

                    Example: 


                    User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

                    User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

                    Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both 5-3 and 3-5 as 2, and so on. The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.

The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
